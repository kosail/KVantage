# KVantage
### Minimal control center for Lenovo laptops on Linux, inspired by GTK and macOS aesthetics.

![KVantage logo](repo_images/main_logo.png)

**KVantage** is a sleek and minimal desktop app designed to provide users of Lenovo laptops running Linux with easy access to essential device settings. Inspired by the clean aesthetics of **GNOME (GTK)** and **macOS**, KVantage is built with **Kotlin + Compose Multiplatform for Desktop**, and aims to offer just the core features users care about. No bloat.

## üöÄ Current Status
- **Development Stage**: The GUI and the backend are completed at 100%. The only functions that is not yet implemented is the option to set a customized battery threshold. By now, it is hardcoded to the default value (which is 80%).
- **Functionality:** The GUI allows toggling performance profiles, battery thresholds, and rapid charge settings.
- **Usability:** Designed to be intuitive, light, and visually appealing, following minimal principles and Gruvbox theming. More themes may be implemented in the future.
- **Known Limitations:**
  1. System compatibility is limited to Lenovo laptops that expose the ACPI interface using the acpi_call kernel module (`/proc/acpi/call`).
  2. The app needs root access to perform the ACPI read and writes at `/proc/acpi/call`. This is a limitation that cannot be bypassed, but it was minimized by asking for the password once for the entire execution of the program, and isolating that mentioned root access to just the backend server.

##  Backend
At first, I thought of using the wonderful project [batmanager, by LevitatingBusinessMan](https://github.com/LevitatingBusinessMan/batmanager) which is exactly what this program aims for, but in CLI format. However, I know no Rust. I couldn't make it work on NixOS (dynamic linking executable issues), and it is my main Linux distro.<br><br>
At the end, due some limitations of the JVM and Kotlin Native, I decided to reimplement batmanager in Golang. More about this in the [backend section below](#backend).

To keep things clean, I will maintain only the GUI app here, and kvand (the backend daemon) in another repository. In this repo you'll only find the native kvand executable. To see kvand source code, comments and notes about it, please check the [daemon's repository here at my GitHub profile](https://github.com/kosail/Kvand).
