**KVantage** is a sleek and minimal desktop app designed to provide users of **Lenovo laptops** running Linux with easy access to essential device settings. Inspired by the clean aesthetics of **Material UI**, KVantage is built with **Kotlin + Compose Multiplatform for Desktop**, and aims to offer just the core features we care about. No bloat.

## 🌻 Current Status
The app is fully functional. The only thing that is not yet implemented is the option to set a customized battery threshold. By now, it is hardcoded to the default value (which is 80%).
  <br><br>

### **Known Limitations:**
  1. **System compatibility is limited to Lenovo laptops** that expose the ACPI interface using the acpi_call kernel module (`/proc/acpi/call`).
  2. The app needs root access to perform the ACPI read and writes at `/proc/acpi/call`. This is a limitation that cannot be bypassed, but it was minimized by asking for the password once for the entire execution of the program and isolating that mentioned root access to just the backend server.

## 🌹 Features

[//]: # (> **Note:** ⚠️  Means partially implemented.)

✅ **Toggle Performance Profiles** (Power saving, Extreme Performance, Intelligent Cooling)  
✅ **Battery Charge Threshold Management**  (AKA limit battery charge at 80% to improve battery lifespan)  
✅ **Rapid Charge Enable/Disable**  
✅ **Show remaining battery life (with option to hide it from settings)**  
✅ **Multiple dark and light themes**   
✅ **Multiple languages available (English, Spanish and Japanese were made by me, while German, French, Portuguese, Korean and Chinese are IA translated). It should change language based on your System's locale.**  
❌ **Custom threshold for battery conservation**: My laptop is a cheap one, and it has no option to set a custom threshold. I may implement this in the future if people ask for it, tho I could not guarantee it works as I would not be able to test it.  
✅ **Native image packaging** (Though I was not able to build a DEB/RPM/AppImage, I implemented a embedded installer that will copy the app into your local user bin folder, and it works fantastically.)

### Planned functionalities:
❌ **Tray icon support**: Compose Multiplatform has evolved a lot in the last year, so this might now be possible! I will look into this later.
~~Sadly, KMP built-in tray support is poor on linux. I tried with KDE, Cinnamon, and Hyprland, but neither of them was recognized by the isTraySupported function, and it just refused to launch.~~

~~I tried alternatives like [ComposeNativeTray](https://github.com/kdroidFilter/ComposeNativeTray), but for some reason, the main action kills the app instead of toggling its visibility. I first thought it was a bug of my code, but after several hours of trial and error and having long discussions with AI, I couldn't figure out what's wrong. I desisted in using it.~~

##  🪷 Backend
At first, I thought of using the wonderful project [batmanager, by LevitatingBusinessMan](https://github.com/LevitatingBusinessMan/batmanager) which is exactly what this program aims for, but in CLI format. However, I know no Rust. I couldn't make it work on NixOS (dynamic linking executable issues), and by the moment I created this project, is my main Linux distro.<br><br>
At the end, due to some limitations of the JVM and Kotlin Native, I decided to reimplement batmanager in Golang. To keep things clean, I will maintain only the GUI app here, and kvand (the backend daemon) in another repository. In this repo you'll only find the native kvand executable (and a source code file just as reference). To see kvand source code, comments, and notes about it, please check the [daemon's repository here at my GitHub profile](https://github.com/kosail/Kvand).

## 📜 Disclaimer & License
This app specifically targets Lenovo laptops. Please do NOT run it if your laptop is not Lenovo. The backend assumes it is run on a Lenovo laptop with a known/defined ACPI table to access the battery, performance, and rapid charge.
This software needs root privileges to run, and thus, expect undefined behavior if you run Lenovo specific ACPI commands in a non-targeted ACPI table. Use it as your own risk.
